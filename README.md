# Geocoding Web App

A web app that allows a user to upload a .csv file from his/her computer. The program then adds latitude and longitude to the file's datapoints. The updated data is presented both on the web page, and as a downloadable file for the user.  

The app is currently being hosted on [Heroku](https://geocoderwebservice.herokuapp.com/).
